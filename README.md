# Practicing packaging, containerization and monitoring

This file is a step by step tutorial to practice basics of app packaging,
containerization and monitoring.
See working example at: <https://github.com/jbudynek/teaching-03-working-example>

## Core app and FastAPI

- prepare your virtual environment

```bash
conda create --name YYMMDD_ia_course --clone base
conda activate YYMMDD_ia_course
```

- the file structure:
  - `app` - holds python code for our application
  - `Dockerfile` - holds docker directive for containerization
  - `requirements.txt` - hold list of python libs, make sure to keep it up to
date during development

```bash
.
├── Dockerfile
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── model.py
└── requirements.txt
```

- write model instantiation code
  - in `app/model.py`, write training code
- write prediction code
  - in `app/model.py`, write prediction code
- test this code

- wrap it in FastAPI
  - in `app/main.py`, create endpoints that call the methods of `model.py`
- try it in a fresh conda environment
  - go to docs `http://localhost:5000/do`
  - with `curl`

```bash
conda activate YYMMDD_ia_course
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py
```

## Docker

- write your `Dockerfile`
  - choose base image
  - install requirements
  - copy app files
  - start uvicorn server
- Build
- Run
- challenge = smallest docker image

```bash
docker build -t fastapiml .
docker run -d --name fastapiml-app -p 5000:5000 fastapiml
```

## Monitoring

- in `model.py`
  - create a way to store features and predictions (in a list)
  - create a function to plot training data distribution and stored
data distribution
- in `main.py`
  - modify predict endpoint to also call storage function in model
  - create endpoint to produce plot
